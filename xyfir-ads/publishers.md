# Payment Info
It's important that you setup your payment info so we can pay you at the end of the month for your earnings. Once on the Publisher's panel, navigate to your account. From here you will be able to set your preferred payment method and matching information. You will be paid on a NET30 basis.

# Creating a Campaign
- Unlike some ad networks, Xyfir Ads does not link a single site/app/etc to your account for displaying advertisements on. Instead we've elected allow each publisher to make separate campaigns for each outlet you want advertisements on.
- A campaign can be for an entire site or application, or just a portion of of either. You have the freedom to make each campaign reach as narrow or wide a spectrum as you wish.

## Creation Process:
- Once you click on the *Create Campaign* navigation link you'll be able to create your campaign.
- **Campaign Name**: This value is for you to easily find the campaign you're looking for in your campaign list. It is not used anywhere else.
- **Site**: Whether your campaign is a site or not, all campaigns should have an address on the web. This can be unique among your campaigns, or multiple campaigns can have the same site. We allow our advertisers to target their advertisement to campaigns under sites they deem relevant to their advertisement.
- **Campaign Type**: Determine whether your campaign is a site (mainly text/image/video content) or an App / Web App (more interactive). At this point in time this selection is unimportant and not currently used. However, we still recommend you select the option you believe to be most correct as we will utilize this in the future.
- **Keywords**: Describe your campaign in as many keywords and phrases as possible. Detailed keyword lists will result in ads that are highly targeted to your campaign. Using keywords that don't relate to your campaign will result in one warning, and then a swift removal from the system.
- **Categories**: We allow you choose up to three categories (and up to 2 sub-categories for each) that describe your campaign. If a sub category is chosen, we will match your campaign with ads in that subcategory as well as parent categories. If your campaign spans a wide range of categories we highly recommend breaking your campaign into multiple smaller, more focused campaigns for better advertisement results. Like keywords, setting categories unrelated to your campaign will result in first a warning, and then a ban.

# Managing a Campaign

## Ending a Campaign
When you end a campaign, all funds in the campaign will be lost and reports will be deleted. You cannot recover a campaign you have ended.

## Reports

- **Views** - How many views your campaign has served.
- **Confirmed Earnings** - These are earnings you're guaranteed to receive. These are earnings generated from views and validated clicks.

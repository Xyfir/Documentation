Xyfir does not guarantee that your ad will receive any specific amount of clicks, views, conversions, or any other unit of measurement for success on your advertisement. By purchasing a slot, your ad that occupies that slot has a chance of being selected and displayed to a user on projects within the Xyfir Network. Projects within the network are able to filter ads based on keywords, type, categories, and however else they see fit. There is no guarantee that your advert will receive more, less, or the same amount of views or clicks as any other advertisements in the repository.

Xyfir retains the right to remove your advertisement from the repository at any time and for any reason without refund, especially in the case of an advertisement that breaks our terms, ad guidelines, or receives a significant amount of complaints from viewers.

Slots cannot be sold or transfered.

Xyfir approving your advert and adding it to our repository does not equate to endorsement of your item by Xyfir, LLC or any of the projects within the Xyfir Network that display your ad.

# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.

## Information Collection and Usage

When ordering, registering, linking services to your account, or at other times on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your email address or other details to help you with your experience. Your information is only stored by Ptorx when you make actions that would require Ptorx to do so. For example when creating an account, proxy email, or other digital items in our app.

We may use the information we collect from you when you register, make a purchase, sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey or marketing communication, surf the website, or use certain other site features in the following ways:

- To personalize your experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product offerings in which you are most interested.
- To improve our website in order to better serve you.

## Mail Collection and Logging

Ptorx itself does not save any mail that is sent or received by our proxy emails unless the specific proxy email has the `Save Mail` feature enabled. When this feature is enabled, a full copy of every incoming email is stored for up to three days after it is received. Most of that information is deleted after three days, and for the next twenty-seven days (thirty total), only limited metadata (not the full message content) is stored. Ptorx does not use the mail we store for any purposes other than to provide optional, user-requested features.

Ptorx uses [MailGun](https://www.mailgun.com/)'s email infrastructure. All incoming and outgoing mail goes through MailGun's servers. MailGun keeps a temporary log of events for thirty days. Ptorx has access to most of these logs, however they are not used except in the instance of an undeliverable message from MailGun to Ptorx. In this instance, only the message's metadata and error messages, and not its body's content, is used to attempt to discover why the message was undeliverable and to update Ptorx to handle it accordingly. This does not usually happen often.

## Information Protection

- Our website is scanned for security holes and known vulnerabilities and updated on a regular basis in order to make your visit to our site as safe as possible.
- Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.
- We implement a variety of security measures when a user places an order enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.
- All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.

## Cookies

Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.

We use cookies as a required part of our login process that keep you logged in for your session. If you turn cookies off, Ptorx will not function properly.

## Third-Party Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information or uploaded data.

Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our website. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.

We do not allow third-party behavioral tracking.

## California Online Privacy Protection Act

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf

According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:

- Users can visit our site anonymously.
- Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.
- Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can be easily be found on the page specified above.
- You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes: on our Privacy Policy page
- Can change your personal information: through the Xyfir Accounts dashboard

## Do Not Track

We don't honor Do Not Track signals because:

- Minimal tracking is required for users to login and for our service to work properly.
- Minimal tracking data is only stored temporarily.

## COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)

When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.

We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.

## Fair Information Practices

The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.

In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:

- We will notify you via email within 7 business days
- We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

## CAN SPAM Act

The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.

We collect your email address in order to:

- Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions
- Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders
- Send you additional information related to your product and/or service

To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:

- Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.
- Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.
- Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.
- Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.
- Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.
  - If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at _contact@xyfir.com_ and we will promptly remove you from **ALL** correspondence.

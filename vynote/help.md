# Documents

## Shortcuts
Shortcuts are available for premium members in all document types. Shortcuts allow you to enter a small string of text and our system will automatically fill in the full message you set.

- Shortcuts can be created and deleted in the `Settings` menu.
- Shortcuts are accessed in documents by typing `${shortcut_name}`.

## Multi-User Documents
Multi-user documents allow you and other Vynote users to work on the same document. Changes are automatically sent to all users working on the document. Document contributors can be managed in the `Contributors` tab of the `Document Controls` menu.

## Templates
Templates can be used by Premium Members in all documents. In the `Templates` tab of the `Document Controls` menu you can load other documents of the same type as a template. Loading a template will replace the current document's content with that of the template.

#### Variables
Variables allow you to insert data in specific pre-determined locations into your document's content when loading the template. A variable can be created in a template simply by typing `{{variable}}` where `variable` is the name you want your variable to use. Then, when you're loading a template into another document you will see input boxes with the names of the variables you placed in your template. The values you set in the input boxes will be inserted at the corresponding variable.

#### Notes
- Templates **cannot** be encrypted. Templates **can** be used with encrypted documents.
- The same variable cannot be present multiple times.

### Premium Member Features
- Free members are limited to adding only two other users to contribute to your document. Premium members can add as many users as they like.
- Any contributors that free members add receive all permissions for the document. If you're a premium member, you can set specific permissions for each user.

## Version Control
Premium members have access to a basic version control system available on all documents. When a version is created, the document's current content is stored in that version. Once a version is created you can revert the document's content the content of the version you are reverting to.

### Notes
- Versions are automatically deleted after 7 days or after 10 following versions have been created.
- Contributors can revert a document to a previous version if they have all permissions.

## Encryption
Premium members can encrypt their document content with an encryption key to ensure that only those who have access to the encryption key can view the content of the document. Free members are still able to access and interact with encrypted documents so long as they have the correct key.

**Note:** Encryption keys are currently unchangeable. If you wish to change a document's encryption key you must create a new document and transfer the content.

### Client-Side Encryption
Client-side encryption means that all the encryption is done on the end-users computer. This means that Vynote **never** receives either your unencrypted content **or** your encryption key. All encryption and decryption takes place in the user's browser.

## Note Documents

### Keyboard Controls
All note-document keyboard controls are available when editing a note element.

- `TAB`: Move the element into the children of the sibling element above it.
- `SHIFT + TAB`: Move the element out of its current parent to become a sibling of its former parent element.
- `ALT + LEFT`: Change the scope to the parent of the currently scoped element.
- `ALT + RIGHT`: Change the scope to the element being edited.
- `ALT + UP`: Hide children elements for the element being edited.
- `ALT + DOWN`: Show children elements for the element being edited.
- `ALT + DELETE`: Delete the element being edited and any children.
- `ALT + ENTER`: Add a child element to the element being edited.
- `CTRL + F`: Focuses on search box.

### Importing and Exporting
Premium members can import and export note documents. Notes can only be imported if they are in the format in which they were exported in. Exported note documents only contain the content of each note element in the proper hierarchy.

## Page Documents
Page documents are a great multi-purpose document solution. Page documents support the full [Markdown Syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and offer both an edit and HTML-preview modes.

## Code Documents
Code documents make it easy to work on a wide range of syntaxes for different file types. More than a 100 different syntaxes are supported. Once a code document is open, you can view and set the document's syntax. It's important to set the correct syntax for code you are working on to ensure you receive proper highlighting.

# xyAnnotations Affiliate System

Our affiliate system allows you to integrate annotations from our site into your applications, sites, or devices, while also providing the opportunity to make a profit reselling xyAnnotations subscriptions or access to xyAnnotations.

## Becoming an Affiliate

To become an affiliate is simple. [Send us a message](https://www.xyfir.com/contact) with a short description of how you'd like to utilize our annotations, and we'll help get your affiliate account setup.

## Subscriptions

The most important thing to understand about our affiliate system is how xyAnnotations subscriptions work, and how you can utilize them within your own applications.

A *subscription key* gives the key holder the ability to download annotations from our site. There are two types of subscription keys: *General Subscription Keys* and *Individual Subscription Keys*, also referred to as *GSK's* and *ISK's* respectively. Both keys give the same amount of access to our annotations, however their pricing, their involvement with your users, and how you can profit using them differs.

### General Subscription Keys (GSK)

Each affiliate account receives a single GSK that gives your entire account the ability to download annotations at any time without the need for having any users on your platform who've purchased subscription keys.

GSK's are charged *per annotation set download*, at a current rate of **$0.012 USD** per set download. This means if your application downloads 500 sets via your GSK, you will owe xyAnnotations $6.00 before factoring in your discount. GSK's must be paid off manually through the xyAnnotations affiliate panel at least every 30 days if the key has accrued costs of at least $5.00. Not paying off your GSK will prevent it from being able to download sets.

### Individual Subscription Keys (ISK)

In addition to GSK's, your affiliate account gives you the ability to generate ISK's, which are linked to individual users on your platform. ISK's can either be hidden from the user and used in the background when they go to download a set; or you can give them access to the key which would give them the ability to take that key and use it on other platforms that accept subscription keys from xyAnnotations.

ISK's cost **$1.50 USD** for 30 days or **$12.00 USD** for 365 days. You must manually pay off ISK's every 7 days. Not paying off your ISK's will result in them being deleted from our system.

You may not use a single ISK for multiple different users on your platform. Likewise, you may not generate more than one key for a single user by switching keys every week to avoid payment.

### Discount

All affiliates receive a discount that increases one percent every **$800 USD** spent. The minimum discount is 10%, and the maximum discount is 25%. Your discount will be applied to your total owed every time you pay off a GSK or ISK.

### Pricing

You are free to charge any amount for ISK's and any amount for access to xyAnnotations via your GSK. Not only are you free to price these however you wish, there are also no restrictions on how you charge your users, if at all. It does not matter whether you sell subscriptions as an additional package, include it in the price of your application, or whatever other setup you deem is appropriate for your system.

## Marketing

Like pricing, xyAnnotations places no restrictions on how you market features or packages that utilize xyAnnotations. You can explicitly state that you support xyAnnotations, or you can make no mention of it whatsoever and market the features xyAnnotations provides you however you feel is best for your product.

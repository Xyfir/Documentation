Are you an author or publisher interested in utilizing the xyAnnotations platform and its tools? While you may use the site just as anyone else would, we'd love to get in touch to help you get the most out of xyAnnotations. For authors big or small, fiction or nonfiction, any genre: we're here to help.

# What is xyAnnotations?

xyAnnotations is like the [Genius](https://genius.com) of ebooks, similar because it hosts machine and user-created annotations, but in addition, it also supports the unique ability to have its annotations integrated directly into an ebook's content. All kinds of annotations are possible: from simple dictionary, explanatory annotations; to criticism; translations; author commentary; background info and insights; and much more. Annotations are not limited to text either: they can be images, videos, interactive maps, links, and so on.

Take a look at our demonstration videos to get a better idea of its capabilities:

# Why annotate with xyAnnotations?

Well first of all, **it's free**, but most importantly: **your readers will love it**. Proving that there's a real demand for our annotations, we've been getting a lot of positive and constructive feedback on Reddit, Wikia, and numerous other forums. We post often around those aforementioned sites, bringing in tens of thousands of views for certain posts. Here are just a few examples:

Annotations created or curated by the author(s) themselves are even more highly valued by readers.

# Which apps/devices support xyAnnotations?

**Almost all of them** -- and yes, that includes Kindle! While most ebook readers do not _natively_ support our system -- which would offer an even better experience to their readers -- we've made great strides in making sure our [Annotate My Ebook](https://annotations.xyfir.com/annotate-my-ebook) tool can convert our annotations into formats usable and user-friendly in almost all of the popular ebook reader apps and devices.

Authors themselves can use the Annotate My Ebook tool to embed annotations into their ebook files or to generate dictionary files to be used alongside their ebooks. Authors can then distribute these files wherever they choose. Aside from authors, normal readers can upload their own copies of ebooks to annotate their books.

# What can xyAnnotations do for me?

The xyAnnotations platform lets you do lots of things, like:

- Interact with the community.
- Easily edit your previously created annotations at any time.
- Easily and automatically generate basic annotations for your book so you can get started annotating its content. Upload your ebook, and our system will attempt to find characters, locations, and other notable things within your book's content. You can then leave the basic annotations our system generates, or edit and create your own.
- Create annotations here on xyAnnotations, and then distribute them anywhere, via annotated copies of your ebooks or a dictionary for use alongside them.

In addition, if you contact us, we can do even more, like:

- Transfer ownership of your existing books already on our site to your account so that you can manage them yourself.
- Help add your books to our database and manage them once added.
- Spotlight your books, annotations, or discussions on our homepage to help increase your exposure.
- Or just about anything. Let us know what you're thinking and we'll see what we can do.

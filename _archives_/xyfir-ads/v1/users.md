Xyfir Ads was built for the average web user. We've done our best to remove everything that people disliked about online advertising from our ads (except for the fact that they're ads). It's our goal to prove to the internet that we truly are different than other ad networks.

# Quality Ads
All of our advertisements must pass a strict set of guidelines when an actual human reviews each and every advertisement. The ads that contain annoying and flashy graphics, misleading titles, malware, etc are all denied from entering our system and being served to users. 

# Privacy
We respect your privacy and are upfront and honest about what information we collect and even give you control over what information we collect. Your information is not being sold, traded, or given to anyone. Not governments, not companies, no one.

## How we track you
- For the most part, we don't. If you're using a service you logged into via your Xyfir Account then your unique Xyfir ID is linked to that service. We use this ID to utilize your ad profile settings that you configured for your Xyfir Account. This means if you set an ad profile filled with information, we will use this information to serve you ads we believe are relevant. If you don't want that kind of personalization, simply make sure your ad profile is empty!
- Other than your Xyfir ID, we collect your IP address and browser signature. These are used to provide you with ads targeted to your country and or region, as well as for validating clicks. Your IP address and browser signature are never stored for more than a day at most.

## What we don't do
Xyfir Ads doesn't save what sites you visit, the times you're online, or the products you might be interested in. We don't save or utilize any information that you don't explicitly provide in your Xyfir Accounts ad profile.

## Third Party Sites
For publishers in our network that aren't owned and controlled by Xyfir, certain things should be noted:
- All publishers are reviewed and approved by an actual person. If a publisher does not meet our standards they are not allowed membership into our network of publishers.
- If you provide them with personal information, they CAN use it to personalize ads through our system. As a requirement for being a publisher on our network we require that each publisher allow the users to disable and or modify what information is used to personalize ads.
- Xyfir Ads publishers that also utilize our login service (Xyfir Accounts), will receive your unique Xyfir ID. If you have provided them with data not available in your Xyfir Ad Profile, they can use this information for personalizing ads for you. Again, publishers are required to allow their users to disable ad personalization or allow you to modify what data is used for personalizing ads.

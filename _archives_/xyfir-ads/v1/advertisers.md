# Adding Funds to Account
- Adding funds to your account is a step required before being able to create an advertisement campaign. You must have at minimum, $10 before creating a campaign.
- Navigate to your 'Account' menu and there you'll be able to add funds to your account. Once funds are in your account you can allocate them to a new campaign or add them to an already existing campaign.

# Creating a Campaign
- A campaign is an advertisement of a specific type. If you want multiple types (text/video/etc) of the same advertisement, you must create multiple campaigns for each. While this may seem inconvenient, it allows for a much greater control and reporting for each advertisement.
- In order to create a campaign, you must have a minimum of $10.00 available in your account to allocate for the campaign creation.

## Ad Approval
Your advertisement must be approved by a Xyfir Ads staff member before going live and being served to publishers. Your advertisement must follow a strict set of rules to be approved. If your advertisement does not meet our guidelines, we will deny your ad and refund the allocated funds to your account. The refund to your account will be minus 10% of the allocated funds, with a minimum taken of $10. So if your ad is denied and the allocated funds amount is only $10, you will not receive a refund at all.

## Ad Guidelines
- The language of the ad must be appropriate for the targeted countries.
- The ad cannot contain any NSFW content. Example: No vulgar language, profanity, nudity, etc.
- The ad cannot link to a site that is under construction, lacking content, or unclear as to the site's relation to the advertisement. In other words: the ad's title and content cannot be misleading and different than the site's actual content.
- The ad cannot link to: Anything illegal, scams, NSFW content, malware, etc.
- The ad cannot contain spelling or major grammatical errors. Serving such ads would make Xyfir Ads, you, and our publishers less professional.
- Use common sense when creating your advertisement. Keep it professional and if you have to question your advertisement, it's probably not acceptable.
- Xyfir Ads has the right to deny any advertisement for any reason

## Creation Process:
It should be noted that many of the values you set for your campaign during creation CANNOT be modified after creation. For a list of what you CAN modify post-creation see [Managing Ad Campaign](#ManagingAdCampaign).

### Step 1 - Basic Info
- **Campaign Name**: This value is for you to easily find the campaign you're looking for in your campaign list. It is not used anywhere else.
- **Advert Type**: The type of advertisement you wish to serve. (text/image/etc)
- **Payment Type**: The action required before we charge you for serving an ad. At this point in time the options are Pay-Per-Click (PPC) and Pay-Per-View (PPV). PPC means you pay when a user clicks on your ad. PPV means you pay when your ad is sent to the user to be viewed. PPC is more expensive than PPV in all cases.
- **Availability**: Currently unavailable at this time.

### Step 2 - User Targeting
- **Genders**: The genders of users you wish to target your advert to. Checking all boxes are leaving all boxes unchecked will target your ad to all genders.
- **Age Ranges**: The age ranges of users you wish to target your advert to. Checking all boxes are leaving all boxes unchecked will target your ad to all ages.
- **Countries / Regions**: The locations of users you wish to target your ad to. Leaving the 'Country' selector blank will target all countries and regions. If you leave the 'Region' selector blank, it will target all regions in a country. It is recommended to leave the regions blank (to select all) unless you truly need to target specific regions within a country.

### Step 3 - Content Targeting
- **Keywords**: Describe your ad in as many keywords and phrases as possible. Detailed keyword lists will result in being served alongside content more relevant to your ad. Using keywords that don't relate to your campaign will result in your ad being denied.
- **Category**: We allow you one category and up to two sub-categories that describe your advertisement. If a sub-category is chosen, we will match your campaign with content in that sub-category as well as parent categories. Like keywords, setting a category unrelated to your campaign will not result in approval.
- **Sites**: The sites (within our publisher network) you wish to display your advertisement on. Note that this is a hard value, meaning that your advertisement will ONLY be displayed on the sites you list. We recommend leaving this blank to target all sites in our network.

### Step 4 - Funding
- **Allocate**: This is an amount of funds you wish to add from your account to your new campaign. The value must be at least $10.00, which is the minimum needed to create a campaign.
- **Daily Limit**: This allows you to set a daily budget, preventing your advert from costing you more than the set amount on any given day. If you don't want to utilize a daily budget, you can leave this set to $0.00.
- **Ad Pricing for Category**:
    While not something you can modify, it's important to understand what each label and it's value means. We allow competing advertisers for a certain ad type and under a certain category to use a bidding system to compete for ad space. If there are other competitors in your category, a higher bid price will ensure you get ad space that your competitors will not.
    - **Base Price**: This is the absolute minimum you can pay per click or view.
    - **Competitors**: How many people have an advertisement of the same type in your category.
    - **Average**: This is the average bid price within the category for your ad type. We recommend being at or above this amount. If you enable automatic bidding, your bid will generally be within a certain range of the average bid.
    - **Highest**: This is the highest bid in the category for your ad type. The advertiser with the highest bid will receive more ad space than competitors in the same category. They will not receive all the ad space however, simply a higher chance of being served where relevant.
- **Bid**: This is the amount you will be charged per click or view. You will be able to modify it after approval to continue competing with others in your category.
- **Automatic Bidding**: If you don't wish to deal with manually setting your bid price, you can enable auto bidding. Automatic bidding means our system will do its best to provide you with the most views or clicks for your money.

### Step 5 - Building Your Ad
- **Link**: This is where you want users to be redirected to when they click on your ad. All ads must have a link, even if they are PPV ads.
- **Title**: The title of your advertisement. This is typically your product, service, or site's name. It should give the viewer a good idea of what the rest of your ad will contain.
- **Description**: Describe your product, service, site, etc here. Be descriptive, but leave out unnecessary details.
- **Upload Videos/Images for Advertisement**: If your advertisement is a video or image ad, you must upload the images and videos. You will be able to provide a download link for each video or image for the required video resolution or image dimensions. Your media must already be hosted somewhere and available for direct download via a URL. We recommend using your cloud host provider of choice (Google Drive, OneDrive, DropBox, etc).

### Step 6 - Final Step
- If you're given an error, determine what you did wrong and return to a previous step to fix the issue.
- If you did not receive an error then you must wait until your advertisement is reviewed and approved or denied by a staff member. This process usually takes a day or two but can happen within just a few minutes if you're lucky.

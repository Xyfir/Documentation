The bulk of all interaction with this subreddit and the sales threads within it will be made by sending commands or doing actions that the bot account [u/xyMarketBot](https://www.reddit.com/user/xyMarketBot) will listen for and act on.

xyMarketBot acts on a one-minute loop, where every one minute it checks for new commands and actions to respond to. xyMarketBot will most likely not respond immediately to your action, but if you don't receive a response within a little over a minute something probably went wrong. Almost always xyMarketBot will notify you if something went wrong, however there are a few instances where it will not respond to invalid commands or actions.

You should avoid attempting to send commands to expired or removed threads except when it is explicitly stated that a command will be accepted (for instance the `repost` command).
